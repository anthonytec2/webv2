  This paper presents a new millimeter-wave sensing system used for near-field
  imaging applications. The presented system is composed of a parabolic
  reflector which is fed by an array of compressive antennas. A Compressive Horn
  Antenna (CHA) is manufactured by inserting a dielectric piece with a
  pseudo-random geometric pattern inside a Pyramidal Horn Antenna (PHA). The
  presented CHA is capable of performing spectral coding, which is of special
  interest for high-sensing-capacity applications. The antenna is fabricated
  using additive manufacturing (3D printing) techniques and then spray coated
  with silver. Near-field measurements are carried out in the near-field region
  of the antenna. The measured fields are then compared with those of the
  full-wave simulations to validate the performance of the fabricated antenna.
  Using the surface equivalence principle, the electric and magnetic fields at
  the aperture of the horn antennas are used to calculate the equivalent
  radiating electric and magnetic currents. These currents are then integrated
  to an in-house physical optics-based solver to feed a parabolic reflector and
  image metallic scatterers in the near-field region of the system. Numerical
  simulations show that the imaging performance of the reflector fed by the CHAs
  outperforms those of the reflector fed by PHAs.
